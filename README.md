CARL: A Roguelike Language
==========================

C.A.R.L. aims to be a general-purpose domain-specific language that 
will solve every issue ever encountered in roguelike development, and 
maybe fix world hunger while it's at it. The name of this project is 
final and may not be debated further.

This is a 4th semester project for the Software course at Aalborg 
University. We can be contacted via e-mail as 
cs-24-sw-4-16@student.aau.dk, if you have any questions for some 
reason or another.
